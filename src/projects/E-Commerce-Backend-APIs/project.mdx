### Overview

This is a back-end RESTful APIs for building a shopping website. Since the back-end apis are totally decoupled with the front-end, it makes it easy for a developer who wants to create a shopping website to use any front-end web frameworks/tools to build the website.

### Demo Website

Note that it might take a while to load a landing page when you visit the website for the first time due to the fact that the app was deployed to the heroku platform. Once the landing page is loaded, you must experience the fast loading speed for any web pages.
