## Overview

In this Part 2 of Webpack Essentials, we will talk about what is the best practice when it comes to writing CSS. We've already configured almost everything we need in Webpack in the Part 1, this article is more about learning how to organize file structure for CSS, identify patterns in desing, and rules to follow for creating CSS class names and selectors, and so on. As a matter of fact, configuring Webpack will be very minimal.

Here is a capture of our complete demo we're going to create using PostCSS, and BEM philosophy. I highly recommend to read the [Part 1](/posts/webpack-essentials-part-1) to follow along the Part 2.

### Getting Started

#### Install dependencies

There are a few dependencies that we want to install before we move on:

```bash
npm install postcss-import postcss-mixins normalize.css --save-dev
```

| Dependencies     | Usage                                                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `postcss-import` | inlines the stylesheets referred to by @import rules                                                         |
| `postcss-mixins` | enables mixins(A mixin lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site) |
| `normalize.css`  | adjusts the styles of certain elements to make all web browsers render things more consistently              |

Before we forget, let's jump back on `webpack.config.js` file and add the two installed PostCSS plugins:

```js file=./webpack.config.js add=4-5
const path = require('path')

const postCSSPlugins = [
  require('postcss-import'),
  require('postcss-mixins'),
  require('postcss-simple-vars'),
  require('postcss-nested'),
  require('autoprefixer'),
]

module.exports = {
  entry: './app/assets/scripts/App.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundled.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'app'),
  },
  devServer: {
    watchFiles: ['./app/**/*.html'],
    static: {
      directory: path.join(__dirname, 'app'),
    },
    hot: true,
    port: 3000,
    host: '0.0.0.0',
  },
  mode: 'development',
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/i,
        use: [
          'style-loader',
          {
            loader: 'css-loader',
            options: { url: false },
          },
          {
            loader: 'postcss-loader',
            options: { postcssOptions: { plugins: postCSSPlugins } },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

#### Starting files

Let's start fresh with `index.html` with a new example. You can delete everything in `index.html` and copy and paste the following:

```html file=./app/index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <link
      href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:ital,wght@0,100;0,200;0,300;0,400;0,500;0,600;0,700;0,800;0,900;1,100;1,200;1,300;1,400;1,500;1,600;1,700;1,800;1,900&display=swap"
      rel="stylesheet"
    />
    <title>Webpack Starter</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Page Section - Cards -->
    <div class="page-section page-section--cards">
      <!-- Section Title -->
      <h2 class="section-title">Featured Blogs</h2>
      <!-- Grid Container -->
      <div id="blog-section" class="grid-container">
        <!-- Card 1 -->
        <a href="#" class="card">
          <div class="card__media">
            <img src="assets/images/card-1.jpg" class="card__image" />
          </div>
          <div class="card__info">
            <h3>Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing.</h3>
            <span class="card__more">Learn more</span>
          </div>
        </a>
        <!-- Card 2 -->
        <a href="#" class="card">
          <div class="card__media">
            <img src="assets/images/card-2.jpg" class="card__image" />
          </div>
          <div class="card__info">
            <h3>
              Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Officia,
              nisi.
            </h3>
            <span class="card__more">Learn more</span>
          </div>
        </a>
        <!-- Card 3 -->
        <a href="#" class="card">
          <div class="card__media">
            <img src="assets/images/card-3.jpg" class="card__image" />
          </div>
          <div class="card__info">
            <h3>
              Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Debitis,
              unde?
            </h3>
            <span class="card__more">Learn more</span>
          </div>
        </a>
      </div>
    </div>

    <script src="bundled.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### Basic CSS File Structure

To structurize our css files, we will jump back on our `styles.css` file and delete everything in it and start fresh. Going forward, the `styles.css` file will have many `@import` statements because we will modularize our CSS codes into separate pieces.

##### styles.css

```css file=./app/assets/styles/styles.css
@import 'normalize.css';
@import 'base/_variables';
@import 'base/_global';
@import 'base/_mixins';
```

##### Base Directory

Let's create `base` directory inside `./app/assets/styles` and then create a `_global.css` & `_variables.css` files inside it. The role of `base` folder is to contain any separate piece of styles that we would like to apply globally or reusable variables that can be used in other parts of partial CSS, and mixins that are groups of CSS declarations that can be reusable throughout our website.

<GatsbyImage image={getImage(props.embeddedImages[1])} alt='demo' />

<blockquote display='info'>
  The _ (underscore) prefix means a partial for PostCSS. That means the
  stylesheet is going to be imported (@import) to our styles.css. The advantage
  on using partials is that you can use many files to organize your code and
  everything will be compiled on a single file.
</blockquote>

1. **\_variables.css**

The PostCSS allows us to use `$` syntax to create a reusable variable, so we will have a partial file named `_variables.css` to be imported in the `styles.css`.

```css file=./app/assets/styles/base/_variables.css
$veryLightGray: #efefef;
$lightBlue: #4477ff;
$cardBgWhite: #ffffff;
```

2. **\_global.css**

Similary, we will have any styles that we want to apply globally in a separte file called `_global.css`.

```css file=./app/assets/styles/base/_global.css
:root {
  --duration: 0.2s;
  --ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.35, 0.01, 0.25, 0.99);
}

body {
  background: $veryLightGray;
  font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;
}

img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}

* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

3. **\_mixins.css**

Because we installed/configured `postcss-mixins` as one of our dev dependencies, we can use mixins in our CSS. A mixin is a group of CSS declarations that can be resued throughout our stylesheets. It can greatly improve code readability as well. For example, with a regular CSS, we have to write a media query like this:

```css file=./app/assets/styles/base/_mixins.css
@define-mixin atTiny {
  @media (min-width: 440px) {
    @mixin-content;
  }
}

@define-mixin atSmall {
  @media (min-width: 530px) {
    @mixin-content;
  }
}

@define-mixin atMedium {
  @media (min-width: 800px) {
    @mixin-content;
  }
}

@define-mixin atLarge {
  @media (min-width: 1010px) {
    @mixin-content;
  }
}
```

We used to write a media query in a lengthy way:

```css
@media (min-width: 440px) {
  text-align: left;
}
```

However, with a mixin defined in `_mixins.css`, we can write like this now:

```css
@mixin atTiny {
  text-align: left;
}
```

##### modules

Create `modules` directory inside `./app/assets/styles`. The `modules` folder will contain many partial stylesheets that consists of our website. For example, since we are planning to make a card as shown in the captured demo, we can create a `_card.css` that consists of styles for the card only. When you want to edit styles for the card in the future, you can simply go to `_card.css` and edit it wihtout touching any other CSS files. This is beauty of modularization.

<GatsbyImage image={getImage(props.embeddedImages[6])} alt='demo' />

```css file=./app/assets/styles/modules/_card.css
.card {
  background: $cardBgWhite;
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15) 0px 5px 15px 0px;
  color: inherit;
  position: relative;
  text-decoration: none;
  transition: var(--duration) var(--ease-out);
}
```

Since we modulaized our css file structure, we need to import the css module into the main `styles.css` file:

```css file=./app/assets/styles/styles.css add=5
@import 'normalize.css';
@import 'base/_variables';
@import 'base/_mixins';
@import 'base/_global';
@import 'modules/_card';
```

Let's set what we've got so far:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should be able to see something like this if everything goes well. I know it is ugly as hell for now. But in the next section, we will identify patterns in design and apply BEM(Block Element Modifier) philosophy to make not only the card design itself, but also overall CSS architecture much better.

<GatsbyImage image={getImage(props.embeddedImages[5])} alt='demo' />

### Identify Patterns In design

#### BEM

Popular abstract way of thinking about our interface.

- **Block**
  - An independent resuable part of our design
  - Examples: header, container, menu, checkbox, input
- **Element**
  - An element belongs to a block.
  - It cannot be used outside of the block that it belongs to.
  - Examples: menu item, list item, checkbox caption, header title
- **Modifier**
  - A modifier can be used on a block or an element to indicate a change to the default state of an object.
  - Examples: disabled, highlighted, checked, fixed, size big, color yellow

```css file=./app/assets/styles/modules/_card.css
.card {
  background: $cardBgWhite;
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15) 0px 5px 15px 0px;
  color: inherit;
  position: relative;
  text-decoration: none;
  transition: var(--duration) var(--ease-out);

  &__info {
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: space-between;
    display: flex;
    padding: 20px;
    flex-direction: column;
    text-align: center;

    @mixin atTiny {
      flex-direction: row;
      text-align: left;
    }

    @mixin atMedium {
      height: 60%;
      flex-direction: column;
      text-align: center;
    }
  }

  &__more {
    border-bottom: 1px solid $lightBlue;
    font-size: 13px;
    padding: 8px 0;
    white-space: nowrap;
    margin: 0 10px;
  }

  &__media {
    height: 0;
    padding-top: 56.25%;
    position: relative;
  }

  &__image {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    object-fit: cover;
    border-top-left-radius: 10px;
    border-top-right-radius: 10px;
    transition: var(--duration) var(--ease-out);
  }

  &:hover {
    transform: scale(1.01);
  }
}
```

There's a lot to digest here, so let's break down the codes piece by piece based on BEM.

- ## Block
- ## Element
- Modifier

Hello, everyone, welcome to Part two of our two part lesson on how to write super organized success.

In part one, we learned about feio architecture.

And in this lesson, part two, we will learn about identifying patterns in our design.

And we will also learn about a few rules and guidelines that we want to follow when coming up with class

names and writing our CSFs selectors.

Let's cut the intro and get started.

So here we are in part two of the lesson.

And let's pick up right where we left off.

So let's continue working on this large hero section.

Now that we have this text positioned correctly, let's focus on styling the text so that it looks like

this.

So let's begin with this.

Your clarity line in the HTML, we see that that is a heading level, one element.

So if we want to begin styling this element, how would we do that?

We would probably go into our large Xeroxed file and create a new rule.

And what would our selector look like?

We'd probably say go into the large hero div and then target any one element.

So, for example, let's make the text be not bold.

So font weight three hundred.

OK, let's head over to the command line and make sure that our web pack task is running.

So just type NPM run Dev.

And let's go back to the text editor and save this CSC file.

And if we refresh in the browser, watch this text.

It is no longer bould, which means our selector is working.

And let's actually talk about this selector for a moment.

So this is how myself and an entire generation of developers were taught to write success.

However, in recent years there has been a move away from using type and descendant selectors like this.

And instead we've seen a move towards a more systematic way of targeting elements.

One of the most popular systems or methodologies for coming up with selectors is named B.M. And in this

course, we are going to follow a lot of the basic BM principles.

Them is an acronym and I will explain what it stands for in just a second.

But first, I want to point out that in VM we would not write a selector like this.

Instead, the best way of doing it would be to go into the HTML and just give this element a class.

Let's go with large hero, underscore, underscore title and then we would simply target the element

with that class in our next large hero underscore underscore title.

Now, some of you might be squirming in your seats right now because this is going against everything

you were originally taught about writing clean semantic HTML.

I know that's how I felt when I first learned about them.

But the truth is that I think we were misguided in the past about what it means to write semantic HTML.

I will circle back to that topic later on in the lesson.

But first, you're probably wondering what these two underscores mean, and that's a perfect Segway

into what the letters BVM stand for.

So first of all, Bam is an abstract way of thinking about our design or interface.

This philosophy or way of thinking can be broken up into three concepts.

The first is the B in Bam, which stands for Block a Block is an independent, reusable part of our

design.

So for an example, let's look at the design file that the designer sent to us.

This large hero section that we've been working on is a block.

As we scroll down the design, I think the next best example of a block would be in the features section.

We see there are four features here, here, here and here.

So I would say that this is an example of a block.

This block is independent.

It can stand on its own and it can be reused.

If we scroll down a bit further, we see the testimonials area.

There are three testimonials and I would say that this is a testimonial block and this block is reused

an additional two times for the other two testimonials.

So B is for `Block.`

Let's move on to the E in Bam.

It stands for `Element.`

An element belongs to a block.

It is dependent on a block, which means it cannot be used outside of the block that it belongs to.

So, for example, if we scroll back up to the top of our design within this large hero block, this

heading is an element.

This heading is also an element.

These headings use font styles and margins that aren't reused anywhere else in the design.

They.

Are unique to this large hero block, perhaps a clearer example of what an element is would be down

here at the bottom in the testimonials area.

So this image that is cropped in a circle is horizontally centered and vertically violates.

This box is an element that belongs to the testimonial block.

We will never want to use this image outside the context of a testimonial.

So conceptually, we think of this image as an element that belongs to this block.

So E is for element.

Let's move on to the M in Bam, which stands for modifier.

A modifier can be used on a block or an element and we use a modifier to indicate a change to the default

state of an object.

So for example, let's imagine we have a mobile menu on a website and by default the menu is hidden

or closed.

But when a user taps on the menu icon, we want to use JavaScript to add a modifier class to the menu.

Block of Dash Dash is open.

That modifier class will modify the block from being closed or invisible to being open invisible.

When the user taps on the menu icon a second time to hide the menu, we will simply use JavaScript to

remove that modifier class and the menu block will be hidden once again, which is its default state.

Let's look at another example of how we can use modifiers.

So, for example, I'm noticing a button style used throughout our design.

Here is one button, here's another button, and then down in the footer.

Here is another button, so because the button is reused throughout the design, conceptually, let's

consider it a block and let's say that this medium sized blue button in the header is the default state

of the button block.

So this button would simply have a class of button, the button that's down in the footer.

Could use that same class of button, but we would add a modifier class of button, dash, dash, orange

to get it to look this way and this large orange button could also use a class of button.

But we would maybe add two modifiers.

One named Button, Dash, Dash, orange and another named button dash, dash large.

And that is modifiers in a nutshell.

All right.

So now we know what the letters in Bems stand for.

## BEM Overview

Now let's talk about a few of the other key concepts and advantages to using them.

- All of our success selectors should target elements directly with classes instead of relying on generic type selectors to send in selectors and the cascade. This means that we are somewhat eliminating the sea from success.

- Since we are limiting the cascading and trickling down of styles on the page, we are creating a one on one relationship between a block of HTML and its success. We don't need to worry about any parent elements trickling their styles down to our blocks and hurting the predictability of our block styles. This means that our blocks are independent, self-contained and we are free to move them around and reuse them throughout the page.

- Another important concept is that blocks can be nested inside of other blocks.

- The idea is to identify patterns in our design and then create single responsibility blocks that can be used together.

  - What does that phrase single responsibility mean?
    - Well, if we look at our design file really quickly, if we scroll down. I see two columns here, this text column takes up about two thirds of the width and this image takes up about one third of the width. We scroll down further. I see columns once again in this our features area. This column takes up about half the width and this column takes up about half the width if we scroll down further. Again, I see columns. There are three columns, one for each testimonial. So clearly columns are a pattern that we have identified in the design and there is no reason to code a pattern more than once. So what I would do is create a block that is responsible for creating column layouts. I would use that block here to create three empty columns and then within each column block I would nest a testimonial block. That way, the column block has the single responsibility of creating column layouts and we can reuse that block throughout the page. And the testimonial block has the single responsibility of creating the unique styling for the testimonials.

- It is that Ben makes the relationship between our HTML and our success crystal clear.

Why does that matter?

Well, if you've ever tried to update a website that you haven't touched in a year or if you've ever

inherited a website that someone else originally built, if that website doesn't use some sort of naming

methodology, trying to edit the website's success is like untangling a plate of spaghetti.

You don't have the confidence to actually edit any of the existing success because you don't know where

the styles are being used and what your changes might break.

And if you can't edit the existing success, what you end up doing.

You throw more spaghetti on top of the plate, right?

So you end up creating brand new styles and sloppily throwing them at the very bottom of a huge file.

And that is not organized at all.

It is not maintainable and it is a developer's nightmare.

With B.M., the relationship between HTML and CSR is clear.

So you can come back to a website a year later and confidently edit the existing styles since you know

exactly where and how those rules will affect the page.

All right, so that's enough B.M. theory for now.

Let's get back to actually writing success.

### Concern Over BEM

But really quickly, before we do, I want to address the one big concern that you might have, because

you might be thinking this Bems stuff is all well and good.

But what about the semantics of our HTML is adding all of these extra classes with presentational names

making our HTML less semantic?

That's a fair question.

The answer is <mark>no</mark>.

Now, instead of me arguing and explaining why that's the case, I will just go ahead and quote someone

who is 100 times smarter than I am and a million times more of an authority in the Web development community

than I am.

His name is **Nicholas Gallagher**.

He's the creator of Normalized Access.

He's very well known and super respected in the Web development community.

And he has [an excellent blog post on HTML semantics](https://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture).

And here are a few quotes for you.

Nicholas says that:

- Class names cannot be on semantic.
- Content layer semantics are already served by each HTML elements.
- Class names impart little or no useful semantic information to machines or human visitors.
- The primary purpose of a class name is to be a hook for success, and JavaScript
- Class names should communicate useful information to developers.

All right, so there you have it.

If adding extra presentational classes doesn't bother Nicholas Gallagher, it definitely shouldn't bother

us.

When you have a free moment, I recommend checking out the full blog post by Nicholas.

It's a great read, but for now, let's get back to actually working on the travel agency website.

So here is what we have so far.

We want this your clarity line to be blue and large to match the design.

So over in our CSC file, within this title rule, let's apply the hexadecimal code for the main blue

color that we will be using throughout the design.

And let's also bump up the font size to four point eight RAM.

If you've never seen REM before, don't worry.

We will cover how REM works in detail shortly.

But for now, let's go ahead and save this and refresh in the browser.

Looks good.

Let's go ahead and begin styling this one trip away heading.

So first let's jump over to our HTML.

Here is that element and let's give it a class so that we can target the Benway.

Let's go with Large Hero.

That's the block that it belongs to.

And this is an element that belongs to the block.

So to indicate that it is an element we say `underscore.`

Underscore.

Or and then the name of the element, let's go with subtitle, and over in our success, we can create

a new rule, large hero, underscore, underscore, subtitle.

We can actually just copy and paste these three declarations and just change the font size to two point

nine.

```css file=./app/assets/styles/modules/_large-hero.css
/* Block */
.large-hero {
  position: relative;
}

/* Element */
.large-hero__text-content {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  transform: translateY(-50%);
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  text-align: center;
}

/* Element */
.large-hero__title {
  font-weight: 300;
  color: #2f5572;
  font-size: 4.8rem;
}

/* Element */
.large-hero__subtitle {
  font-weight: 300;
  color: #2f5572;
  font-size: 2.9rem;
}
```

Let's refactor the css codes to take advantage of BEM and PostCSS nested rules.

```css file=./app/assets/styles/modules/_large-hero.css
/* Block */
.large-hero {
  position: relative;

  /* Element */
  &__text-content {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    transform: translateY(-50%);
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    text-align: center;
  }

  /* Element */
  &__title {
    font-weight: 300;
    color: #2f5572;
    font-size: 4.8rem;
  }

As you see, `&` replaced `.large-hero` on the class name of each nested element.

Then go ahead and save that and refresh in the browser.

Looks good.

There might be a bit too much margin or spacing between the two headings.

We can adjust that in just a moment.

But first, before we go any further, I want to show you a neat post postboxes nesting trick.

So normally when we write postboxes or SAS, we like to make use of the nesting feature to conceptually

group code that is related to each other.

So, for example, here is the main rule for the large hero block.

And these three rules are selecting elements that belong to this block.

So conceptually, it would make sense to take one of these, for example, and try to nest it within

this large hero rule.

Now, if I save this and we take a look at the access file that postseasons generates for us, we see

that the nesting feature gets compiled into a descendant selector.

And while this will work in the browser, so if I refresh the positioning stays intact.

Descendant selectors go against the B.M. philosophy.

We want to avoid descendant selectors whenever we can because they often create specificity, because

if we instead select elements with direct class selectors, we can maintain a very flat CSFs architecture

or a flat specificity tree.

We will talk about why that's important later on in the course.

But for now, the question becomes how can we have the best of both worlds?

How can we write nested ceased to help us stay organized conceptually without having WABAC compile things

down to a descendant selecter?

Well, check out this little trick.

So back in our large hero file, within this nested rule, let's change its selector to simply an ampersands.

Go ahead and hit save.

Now, if we check out the success that gets generated for us, we see that the ampersand was replaced

with the root rules selector.

So for example, if we say ampersand Hello World and hit save that gets compiled into the root selector

and then it just adds on whatever we type hello world so we can adapt this behavior to fit the Bam philosophy

perfectly.

So we know that just the ampersand will give us large hero and then we can say underscore, underscore

text content.

Go ahead and hit save.

That will generate the exact BEM class name, so if we refresh in the browser.

Things still look good.

We are following the B.M. philosophy and we now get to use nested success, so we are having our cake

and eating it too.

Let's go ahead and move these other two rules into the main block rule.

So let's copy this.

Pasted into this block rule and replaced large hero.

With an ampersand, let's do the same thing for this subtitle rule pasted in here, remove the large

hero ampersand.

Excellent so we can already see how organized our success is becoming.

Our main success file imports in different single responsibility access files.

And within our CSFs Modules folder, we will have a new file for each block of the design.

So within this module or block file, we have our base block rule and then we can nest all of the beam

elements within that one rule.

And that will bring this lesson to a close.

Now that we speak the same BEM language and are familiar with the basic B.M. syntax rules, we can begin

making a ton of progress.

In our next lesson, we will finish the styling for the large hero block and we will also begin and

complete the styling for the button block.

It's going to be a lot of fun.

There won't be as much theory weighing us down and I will see you in the next lesson.
