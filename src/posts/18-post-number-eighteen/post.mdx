## Overview

This article will help you to publish your gatsby site to github pages .So we can take a look at what each of these technologies are in brief

### Gatsby

Gatsby is a react based ,GraphQL powered static site generator . It simply means it combines the power of react ,GraphQL ,web pack and other front end tools to offer a great developer Experience

### GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and easily published through GitHub.Any static site can be published using gh-pages.You can know more about them here

## Steps

1. Update brew

  ```
  $ brew update
  ```

2. Install zlib sqlite xz installed on your machine

  ```
  $ brew install zlib sqlite xz
  ```

3. Brew install Pyenv

  ```
  $ brew install pyenv
  ```


4. Restart the terminal for changes to take effect or run `exec "$SHELL"`

  ```
  $ exec "$SHELL"
  ```

5. Add exports to the current terminal window

  <blockquote display="info">
    The zlib compression algorithm and the SQLite database are dependencies for pyenv and often cause build problems when not configured correctly. Add these exports to your current terminal window to ensure the installation completes:
  </blockquote>

  ```
  $ export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/zlib/lib -L/usr/local/opt/sqlite/lib"
  $ export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/zlib/include -I/usr/local/opt/sqlite/include"
  ```

6. Check out some available versions of python > 3.9.*

  ```
  $ pyenv install --list | grep 3.9.
  ```

7. Install python 3.9.4

  It will take some time to finish the installation.

  ```
  $ pyenv install 3.9.4
  ```

8. Make 3.9.4 as global python version

  ```
  $ pyenv global 3.9.4
  ```

9. Check the version

  ```
  $ pyenv version
  ```
  You should see `3.9.4 (set by /Users/youngjaelim/.pyenv/version)`.

10. Configure `.zshrc`

  <blockquote display="info">
  The power of pyenv comes from its control over our shell's path. In order for it to work correctly, we need to add the following to our configuration file (.zshrc for me, possibly .bash_profile for you)
  </blockquote>
  
  ```
  $ echo -e 'if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then\n eval "$(pyenv init --path)"  eval "$(pyenv init -)"\nfi' >> ~/.zshrc
  ```

11. Check to make sure .zshrc updated

  ```
  $ cat ~/.zshrc
  if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then
    eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
    eval "$(pyenv init -)"
  fi
  ```

12. Restart the terminal for changes to take effect or run exec "$SHELL".

  ```
  $ exec "$SHELL"
  ```

13. Check python version

  ```
  $ python -V
  Python 3.9.4

  $ python
  Python 3.9.4 (default, May 22 2021, 00:50:28) 
  [Clang 12.0.5 (clang-1205.0.22.9)] on darwin
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>> quit()
  ```

14. Upgrade the pip and setuptools packages

  ```
  # To avoid the persistent warning about upgrading the pip package. 
  # It would be best if you upgrade the pip package.
  $ pip install -U pip setuptools

  $ pip list
  Package    Version
  ---------- -------
  pip        21.1.1
  setuptools 56.2.0
  $ ~ %
  ```
