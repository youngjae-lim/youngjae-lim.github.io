## Overview

Pyenv lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Python. It's simple, unobtrusive, and follows the UNIX tradition of single-purpose tools that do one thing well.

## Steps

1. Update brew

  ```bash
  brew update
  ```

2. Install zlib sqlite xz installed on your machine

  ```bash
  brew install zlib sqlite xz
  ```

3. Brew install Pyenv

  ```bash
  brew install pyenv
  ```


4. Restart the terminal for changes to take effect or run `exec "$SHELL"`

  ```bash
  exec "$SHELL"
  ```

5. Add exports to the current terminal window

  <blockquote display="info">
    The zlib compression algorithm and the SQLite database are dependencies for pyenv and often cause build problems when not configured correctly. Add these exports to your current terminal window to ensure the installation completes:
  </blockquote>

  ```bash
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/zlib/lib -L/usr/local/opt/sqlite/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/zlib/include -I/usr/local/opt/sqlite/include"
  ```

6. Check out some available versions of python > 3.9.*

  ```bash
  pyenv install --list | grep 3.9.
  ```

7. Install python 3.9.4

  It will take some time to finish the installation.

  ```bash
  pyenv install 3.9.4
  ```

8. Make 3.9.4 as global python version

  ```bash
  pyenv global 3.9.4
  ```

9. Check the version

  ```bash
  pyenv version
  ```
  You should see `3.9.4 (set by /Users/youngjaelim/.pyenv/version)`.

10. Configure `.zshrc`

  <blockquote display="info">
  The power of pyenv comes from its control over our shell's path. In order for it to work correctly, we need to add the following to our configuration file (.zshrc for me, possibly .bash_profile for you)
  </blockquote>
  
  ```bash
  echo -e 'if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then\n eval "$(pyenv init --path)"  eval "$(pyenv init -)"\nfi' >> ~/.zshrc
  ```

11. Check to make sure .zshrc updated

  ```bash
  cat ~/.zshrc
  ```

12. Restart the terminal for changes to take effect or run exec "$SHELL".

  ```bash
  exec "$SHELL"
  ```

13. Check python version

  ```bash
  python -V
  ```

14. Upgrade the pip and setuptools packages

  To avoid the persistent warning about upgrading the pip package, it would be best if you upgrade the pip package.

  ```bash
  pip install -U pip setuptools
  pip list
  ```
