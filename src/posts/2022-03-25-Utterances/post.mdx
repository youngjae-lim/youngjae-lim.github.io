## Overview

This article shows you how to add `utterances` light weight comments widget to your Gatsby website. The widget is built on `GitHub` issues.

## Caveats

- Needs Github authentication by users to make a comment
- There is no reply functionality

## What you need

1. Public Github Repository
2. ...

```jsx file=./src/components/Comments.js highlights=7,11
import React, { useEffect } from 'react'

const COMMENTS_ID = 'comments-container'

const Comments = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!process.env.GATSBY_COMMENTS_REPO) return

    const script = document.createElement('script')
    script.src = 'https://utteranc.es/client.js'
    script.setAttribute('repo', process.env.GATSBY_COMMENTS_REPO)
    script.setAttribute('issue-term', 'pathname')
    script.setAttribute('theme', 'icy-dark')
    script.setAttribute('crossorigin', 'anonymous')
    script.async = true

    const comments = document.getElementById(COMMENTS_ID)
    if (comments) comments.appendChild(script)

    // This function will get called when the component unmounts
    // To make sure we don't end up with multiple instances of the comments component
    return () => {
      const comments = document.getElementById(COMMENTS_ID)
      if (comments) comments.innerHTML = ''
    }
  }, [])

  return (
    <div>
      <h4>Comments</h4>
      <div id={COMMENTS_ID} />
    </div>
  )
}

export default Comments
```

## Setup Gatsby Environment Variable

### For your local development

Let's add the following codes to the top of `gatsby-config.js` to use an environment variable in Gatsby:

```js file=./gatsby-config.js
require('dotenv').config({
  path: `.env`,
})
```

Then create `.env` file in your project root and add a key and a value pair to indicate our repo for uttterances comment system:

```dot file=./.env
GATSBY_COMMENTS_REPO=<github_owner_name>/<github_repository_name_connected_to_utterances>
```

With this configuration, now the `Comments` component that we've created above will have access the env variable using `process.env.GATSBY_COMMENTS_REPO` syntax. The Post template that imports the `Comments` component shoudl be able to render the comment without any issues in your local development environment.

<GatsbyImage
  image={getImage(props.embeddedImages[4])}
  alt='utterance comment'
/>

### For your production development

The above setting definitely works in the dev environment, but how about production environment? We have two concerns to address:

1. Because we are not pushing our `.env` file to the remote repository by adding `.env` to the `.gitignore` file, we have to add one manually to our Github repository **Settings**:

{' '}
<blockquote display='warning'>
  Note that pushing .env file with sensitive data to a remote repository is
  always dangerous practive, so it should be avoided.
</blockquote>

2. Because I publish my site to Github pages using GitHub Actions, the workflows script needs to be able to access and read the environment variable during the deploying process. To set it:

For those who missed reading my article on how to deploy Gatsby website to github pages using github actions, please refer to [How To Deploy Gatsby Website To GitHub Pages Using GitHub Actions](https://youngjae-lim.github.io/posts/how-to-deploy-gatsby-to-github-pages).

#### Add a Github Secret Key

Go to **GitHub>Settings** of your repository and add a secret key:

<GatsbyImage
  image={getImage(props.embeddedImages[3])}
  alt='github env variable'
/>

#### Update Github Actions

Then let's make some changes to the `deploy.yml` that creates the same `.env` file to the original github actions that I've been using so far:

```yml file=./github/workflows/deploy.yml delete=33 add=34-37
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions
name: CI

# Controls when the action will run.
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the dev branch
  push:
    branches: [dev]
  pull_request:
    branches: [dev]
  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup Node.js environment
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2.1.5
        with:
          # Version Spec of the version to use.  Examples: 12.x, 10.15.1, >=10.15.0
          node-version: 16
      - run: npm ci

      - run: npm run build --if-present
      - run: |
          touch .env
          echo GATSBY_COMMENTS_REPO=${{ secrets.GATSBY_COMMENTS_REPO }} >> .env
          npm run build --if-present

      - run: npm test

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4.2.5
        with:
          branch: gh-pages # The branch the action should deploy to.
          folder: public # The folder the action should deploy.
