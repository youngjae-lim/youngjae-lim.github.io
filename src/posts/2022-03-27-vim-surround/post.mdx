## Overview

If you're using `Vim` as your text/code editor, you may have heard about [Tim Pope](https://github.com/tpope). He is one of the best in creating vim plugins out there and there are so many useful plugins that he created, but my first pick is his `sourround.vim` plugin.

### vim-surround plugin

I am a big fan of `vim-surround` plugin which allows me to easily add surroundings such as parentheses, brackets, quotes, HTML tags, etc. Ever since I switched to Vim from VS Code, this plugin greately improved my productivity on coding in Vim.

#### Change surroundings with `cs`

| Before         | Command                                             | After                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| "Vim Surround" | `cs"'` (change surrounding from " to ')             | 'Vim Surround'              |
| 'Vim Surround' | `cs'<span>` (change surrounding from ' to span tag) | `<span>Vim Surround</span>` |

What if you want to change any tag surroundings with any character?

For example, you have `<p>Vim Surround</p>`. You want to replace p tag with a single qoute:

| Before                | Command                                                                   | After          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `<p>Vim Surround</p>` | `cst'` (change the surrounding tag to a single quote), t is short for tag | 'Vim Surround' |

#### Delete surroundings with `ds`

| Before                | Command                                                                  | After        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| "Vim Surround"        | `ds"` (delete the surrounding ")                                         | Vim Surround |
| `<a>Vim Surround</a>` | `dst` (delete the surrounding a tag)                                     | Vim Surround |
| (123)456789           | `ds)` (delete the surrounding parentheses) while the cursor on the (123) | 1234567890   |

#### Make surroundings with `ys`

Note that `ys` stands for `you surround`.

| Before       | Command                        | After            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Vim Surround | `ysiw` with the cursor on Vim  | [ Vim ] Surround |
| Vim Surround | `ysiw` with the cursor on Vim  | [Vim] Surround   |
| Vim Surround | `ysiw{` with the cursor on Vim | { Vim } Surround |
| Vim Surround | `ysiw}` with the cursor on Vim | {Vim} Surround   |
| Vim Surround | `ysiw}` with the cursor on Vim | {Vim} Surround   |

You can also wrap the <mark>entire line</mark> in parentheses or brackets with `yss` command:

| Before          | Command | After               |
| --------------- | ------- | ------------------- |
| This is a line. | `yss[`  | [ This is a line. ] |
| This is a line. | `yss]`  | [This is a line.]   |
| This is a line. | `yss{`  | { This is a line. } |
| This is a line. | `yss}`  | {This is a line.}   |

Of course, you can use any characters like "", or '' to wrap the entire line, too:

| Before          | Command                       | After             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------- |
| This is a line. | `yss"` with the cursor on Vim | "This is a line." |
| This is a line. | `yss'` with the cursor on Vim | 'This is a line.' |

#### Wrap around tags or text with a new tag in <mark>Visual Mode</mark>

So far all the commands that we ran work under the <mark>Normal Mode</mark>. What if you want to wrap around the multiple lines of html elements? Here is an example:

```html
<li>1</li>
<li>2</li>
<li>3</li>
<li>4</li>
```

I would like to surround the four `li` elements with `ul` element. With the help of `vim-surround`:

1. Visually select(i.e., linewise `visual mode`) the lines of code by pressing a capital `V` the line(s) of codes and
2. then hit `S<ul>`. This will make:

```html add=1,6
<ul>
  <li>1</li>
  <li>2</li>
  <li>3</li>
  <li>4</li>
</ul>
```

We've been through lots of commands, but they are very intuitive to use when you code. I hope you enjoyed it and please comment below if you have any questions.
