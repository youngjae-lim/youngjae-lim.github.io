## Overview

Ever since I switched to Vim from VS Code, I always wanted to write down and organize useful Vim commnds that I've learned throughout the years. Because there are so many commands that I want to share, I am going to break them down in several parts. The first part is for moving around in Vim and these commands are essential to take your journey into Vim world.
