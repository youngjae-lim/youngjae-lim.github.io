## Overview

This article shows you some useful vim commands that I enjoy using particularly when I code. I will add more commands once in a while, so this article will be constantly updated. I will keep you posted on that.

### vim-surround plugin

I am a big fan of `vim-surround` plugin which allows me to easily edit `HTML`. One of annoying thing when editing HTML is that you have to surround a certain set of elements with anther element. For example,

  ```html
  <span>Hello!!</span>
  ```

I would like to surround the `span` element with `div` element. Here is just one line of span element. But what if you have many lines of elements that you want to surround? Then what I usually do is to auto complete the `div` tag and move the `span` tag bewteen the opening div and the closing div.

But with the help of `vim-surround`, you just visually select(i.e., linewise `visual mode`) the line(s) of codes that you woudl like to surround and then hit `S<div>`. This will make:

  ```html add=1,3
  <div>
    <span>Hello!</span>
  </div>
  ```
