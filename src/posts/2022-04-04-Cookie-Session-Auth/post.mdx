## Overview

In this article, we will take a look at how <mark>hooks</mark>, particularly `handle` & `getSession` work in SvelteKit. Then I will show a usecase of `hooks` in a simple app. A user will be able to login and we will authenticate the user and set a cookie. Then whenever the user visits a page, we will check if the cookie is in the request to determine whether or not he/she is authorized to visit the page.

## What is Hooks?

In programming, a hook is a place and usually an interface provided in packaged code that allows a programmer to insert customized programming. If you are familiar with a middlware in a server-side programming of `node.js` and `express.js`, that is considered as a hook because it does certain things inside the middleware by accessing to a request and a response object.

In SvelteKit, there are currently four functions provided as part of hooks at the time of this writing:

- `handle`
- `handleError`
- `getSession`
- `externalFetch`

To be able to do cookie-session authentication, we need only two of them: `handle` & `getSession`.

Let's dive into each of them and check out how they work.

## Getting started

Create a skeleton Sveltekit project and spin up a dev server.

```bash
npm init svelte@next cookie-session-auth
cd cookie-session-auth
vim . # Or code . if you use a VS Code editor
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open up a browser and access `http://locahost:3000`. You should be able to see a welcome page.

### getSession

In this section, we will take a look at how to create a session data on a server using `getSession` and access it from a client side using two methods:

1. [$app/stores](/posts/cookie-session-auth-in-sveltekit#1-using-appstores)
2. [load](/posts/cookie-session-auth-in-sveltekit#2-using-load-function)

`getSession()` runs whenever SvelteKit server-renders a page. It takes an `event` object and returns a `session` object that is available on the client side. Note that the `session` object must be serializable, which means that it must not contain things like functions or classes.

To use `getSession`, we must create a `hooks.js` file in our `./src` directory:

```jsx file=./src/hooks.js
export const getSession = event => {
  console.log(event)

  return {
    user: {
      id: '1h4jk90ds',
      name: 'John Doe',
      role: 'admin',
    },
  }
}
```

Go back to your terminal and check out the `event` object printed out:

```js file=console.log(event) highlights=3
{
  clientAddress: [Getter],
  locals: {},
  params: {},
  platform: undefined,
  request: Request {
    size: 0,
    follow: 20,
    compress: true,
    counter: 0,
    agent: undefined,
    highWaterMark: 16384,
    insecureHTTPParser: false,
    [Symbol(Body internals)]: {
      body: null,
      stream: null,
      boundary: null,
      disturbed: false,
      error: null
    },
    [Symbol(Request internals)]: {
      method: 'GET',
      redirect: 'follow',
      headers: [Object],
      parsedURL: [URL],
      signal: null,
      referrer: undefined,
      referrerPolicy: ''
    }
  },
  routeId: '',
  url: URL {
    href: 'http://localhost:3000/',
    origin: 'http://localhost:3000',
    protocol: 'http:',
    username: '',
    password: '',
    host: 'localhost:3000',
    hostname: 'localhost',
    port: '3000',
    pathname: '/',
    search: '',
    searchParams: URLSearchParams {},
    hash: ''
  }
}
```

As you see, we have lots of information available in the `event` object. Please pay attention to the highlighted line `locals:{},`. In the [example](/posts/cookie-session-auth-in-sveltekit#example-cookie-session-authentication), we will populate this `locals` object through `handle` function that will run on the server every time it receives a request. What this means is that intead of populating the user data inside `getSession` as we did above, we will intercept the request first and populate the user session data via `locals` object using `handle`.

Because the `getSession` returns a `session` object to a client, whatever we pass in the `session` object will be accessible through two ways in the client side:

#### 1. Using `$app/stores`

`$app/stores` is one of built-in modules in SvelteKit. To access the session data we populated on the server, we can import `session` from `$app/stores` on the client. The `session` object has two important characteristics:

1. <mark>Contextual</mark>

- What this means is that it is added to the context of the root component of our app.

2. <mark>Unique</mark>

- It is also unique to each request on the server. What this means that the `session` is not shared between multiple requests handled by the same server simultaneously.

These two properties make the `session` so useful to store user-specific data. To use stores, it is important to note that we must subscribe to it while component is being initialized. Using `$session` would do subscription for us convienently.

```jsx file=./src/routes/index.svelte highlights=2,6
<script>
  import { session } from "$app/stores";
</script>

<h1>Session Object</h1>
{JSON.stringify($session)}
```

Make sure to spin up dev server and access `http://localhost:3000` in a browser:

<GatsbyImage image={getImage(props.embeddedImages[1])} alt='sveltekit' />

#### 2. Using `load` function

You can also use `load` to access the `session` object as well by modifying the `index.svelte`. To understand how `load` function works in SvelteKit, you can read [this article](/posts/data-from-endpoint-to-layouts-to-pages-in-sveltekit).

```jsx file=./src/routes/index.svelte
<script context="module">
  export const load = ({ session }) => {
    return {
      props: {
        session,
      },
    };
  };
</script>

<script>
  export let session;
</script>

<h1>Session Object</h1>
{JSON.stringify(session)}
```

Make sure to spin up dev server and access `http://localhost:3000` in a browser:

<GatsbyImage image={getImage(props.embeddedImages[1])} alt='sveltekit' />

### handle

`handle()` runs on the server every time SvelteKit receives a request. It receives two objects as the function arguments:

- an `event` object that carries the request and
- a `resolve` function that invokes SvelteKit's router and generates a response

Through the `handle`, we can modify both the request and a response.

Update the `hooks.js` file in the project root directory with the following changes:

```jsx file=./src/hooks.js add=1-11
export const handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
  console.log(event)

  event.locals.userName = 'Mary Doe'

  const response = await resolve(event)

  response.headers.set('x-custom-header', 'custom-header')

  return response
}

export const getSession = event => {
  console.log(event)

  return {
    user: {
      id: '1h4jk90ds',
      name: 'John Doe',
      role: 'admin',
    },
  }
}
```

#### What this code does

We've added another function `handle` that receives `event` and `resolve`. The `console.log(event)`(line 2) will spit out the same object in the terminal as we've seen from `getSession` example with `locals: {},` in it. However, we populate `locals` with `userName: 'Mary Doe'` right before resolving the request in `handle` function so that `getSession` will receive `event` object with the populated `locals` in it.

Then we immediately resolve the event to receive a response(line 6). We attach a custom header to the original response(line 8) that is going to sent to the client. If you open up your browser's developer tool and inspect the repsonse headers after accessing `http://localhost:3000`, there will be `x-custom-header: custom-header`:

<GatsbyImage image={getImage(props.embeddedImages[2])} alt='sveltekit' />

The `getSession` function is exactly the same as before. But check your terminal again, you will see that this time the `console.log(event)`(line 12) printed out `locals: { userName: 'Mary Doe' },` in the terminal because the `handle` had intercepted the request and added the `userName`.

### Example: Cookie Session Authentication

Now that we know how `getSession`, `handle` work in SvelteKit, we can take a step further to do a cookie session authentication in a simple app. The app itself won't be a complete form, but it would suffice to show how things are put together to make authentication work in SvelteKit.

Let's work on making authentication endpoints first.

#### App Structure

<GatsbyImage image={getImage(props.embeddedImages[6])} alt='sveltekit' />

#### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install cookie uuid
```

#### Login Page

Let's get started with creating a new page `login.svelte` in `./src/routes` directory:

```jsx file=./src/routes/login.svelte
<script>
  let msg = "";

  const login = async () => {
    const res = await fetch("/api/login", {
      method: "POST",
      // For demonstration purpose, we just hard-coded a user email and password
      body: JSON.stringify({
        email: "johndoe@example.com",
        password: "secret",
      }),
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
    });

    const data = await res.json();

    if (!res.ok) {
      msg = data.msg;
      return;
    }

    msg = data.msg;
  };
</script>

<h1>Login</h1>
<button on:click={login}>Login</button>
<p>{msg}</p>
```

Basically, what this code does is that once a user clicks the login button, it will make a HTTP POST request to the `/api/login` endpoint. Depending on the server response, it will display the corresponding(i.e., login success or fail) message on the login page.

#### Login Endpoint

To handle the HTTP POST request from the login page, we have to create a matching endpoint:

```jsx file=./src/routes/api/login.js
import { serialize } from 'cookie'
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid'

export const post = async ({ request }) => {
  const user = await request.json()
  console.log(user)

  // In a real life situation, the password must to be hashed/salted and compared to database
  if (!(user.email === 'johndoe@example.com' && user.password === 'secret')) {
    return {
      status: 401,
      body: {
        msg: 'Invalid email or password',
      },
    }
  }

  const sessionId = uuidv4()
  console.log(sessionId)

  const headers = {
    'Set-Cookie': serialize('session_id', sessionId, {
      httpOnly: true,
      sameSite: 'lax',
      maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, // 7 days
      secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
      path: '/',
    }),
  }
  console.log(headers)

  return {
    status: 200,
    headers,
    body: {
      msg: 'Login successful!',
    },
  }
}
```

Let's break down what this code does:

- The `/api/login.js` endpoint will receive a HTTP POST request from a client and check if a user email and a password are valid.
  The console-logged `user` in line 6 is:

  ```
  { email: 'johndoe@example.com', password: 'secret' }
  ```

- If the email or the password are not valid, it returns a `status 401` with a message, `Invalid email or password`.
- Otherwise, it creates a session id with the help of `uuid` package and
  The `session_Id` will be something like this:

  ```
  49914bf9-64e6-424a-bb2e-df7348882256
  ```

- Then it also generates a `Set-Cookie` headers with the session id using `cookie` package.
  The `headers` is set like:

  ```
  {
    'Set-Cookie': 'session_id=49914bf9-64e6-424a-bb2e-df7348882256; Max-Age=604800; Path=/; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax'
  }
  ```

  | Set-Cookie Attribute | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                 |
  | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `httpOnly`           | By setting it `true`, this prevents the client javascript from accessing the cookie                                                                                         |
  | `sameSite`           | This sets the `Same-Site` attribute in the cookie. The cookies are sent when a user is navigating to the origin site only.                                                  |
  | `maxAge`             | This sets the `Max-Age` attribute in the cookie. It lets the cookie be deleted in the browser when a specified period is over.                                              |
  | `secure`             | By setting it `true`, the cookie is sent to the server only when a request is made with the `https:` scheme.                                                                |
  | `path`               | This indicates the path that must exist in the requested URL for the browser to send the `Cookie` header. We set it to `/` so that the cookie will be sent to each request. |

- Once the header is created, we finally return an object with a `status 200`, the headers, and a body message `Login successful!`.

#### Hooks: handle, getSession

```jsx file=./src/hooks.js
import { parse } from 'cookie'

export const handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
  // Print out cookie in the terminal
  // It will be something like: session_id=49914bf9-64e6-424a-bb2e-df7348882256
  console.log(event.request.headers.get('cookie'))

  // Parse cookie
  const cookies = parse(event.request.headers.get('cookie') || '')
  console.log('cookies: ', cookies)

  // Attach a user object with the cookies to the event.locals
  event.locals.user = cookies

  // Determine whether or not a user is authenticated by checking out the sesssion_id
  if (!cookies.session_id) {
    event.locals.user.authenticated = false
  } else {
    event.locals.user.authenticated = true
  }

  // Resolve the request
  const response = await resolve(event)

  return response
}

export const getSession = event => {
  console.log(event.locals.user)
  const user = event.locals.user

  if (!user.session_id) {
    return {}
  }

  return {
    user,
  }
}
```

##### <mark>handle</mark>

Let's break down what this code does:

- `handle` will take an event object as an argument and get a cookie object from `event.request.headers`.
- Then it parses the cookie using `parse()` from cookie package
  The parsed cookie will be like this:
  ```
  { session_id: '49914bf9-64e6-424a-bb2e-df7348882256' }
  ```
- Then we set `event.locals.user` to the parse cookie.
- If the cookie has a session id, we attche `authenticated` key with a value`true`, otherwise 'false' to the `event.locals.user`.
- Then we resolve the request and return a response.

##### <mark>getSession</mark>

Because the `handle` has intercepted the request and already determinied whether or not a user is authenticated, we can set a session object using `getSession` so that it can be available in the client.

- `getSession` takes an event object that has passed through `handle`. When you console log `evnet.locals.user`, you will be able to see:
  ```
  {
    session_id: '49914bf9-64e6-424a-bb2e-df7348882256',
    authenticated: true
  }
  ```
- If the user does not have a session id, then we return nothiing.
- Otherwise, we return the user object.

### Back to Login Page

In your browser, please access `http://locahost:3000/login`. Once you click `Login` button in the login page, you will be able to see the `Login successful` message:

<GatsbyImage image={getImage(props.embeddedImages[4])} alt='sveltekit' />

Because the login is successful, the `/api/login` endpoint returns the headers with `Set-Cookie` header as a part of response. When the client receives the status 200, the `session_id` will be available in your local browser. You can confirm this from your chrome developer tool:

<GatsbyImage image={getImage(props.embeddedImages[5])} alt='sveltekit' />

The `session_id` will be effective for 7 days as we've set `maxAge` to 7 days, so every time you send another request to the server, the server will run `hooks.js` and receive a `cookie` headers as part of request and attempt to check if the user is authenticated or not through `handle`.

### Main Page

Since we would like to confirm that the client gets the `session` data, let's use `load` function to access `session` and display it:

```jsx file=./src/routes/index.svelte
<script context="module">
  export const load = ({ session }) => {
    return {
      props: {
        session,
      },
    };
  };
</script>

<script>
  export let session;
</script>

<h1>Session Object</h1>
{JSON.stringify(session)}
```

Assuming that you've successfully logged in and hit the main page `http://locahost:3000`, you will be able to see the user's session data displayed like this:

<GatsbyImage image={getImage(props.embeddedImages[3])} alt='sveltekit' />
