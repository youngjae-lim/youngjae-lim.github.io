# Docker Basics Part 1

## Images & Containers

### Images

- Images are one of the two core building blocks Docker is all about (the other one is
"Containers").
- Images are blueprints / templates for containers. They are read-only and contain the
application as well as the necessary application environment (operating system, runtimes, tools,
...).
- Images do not run themselves, instead, they can be executed as containers.
- Images are either pre-built (e.g. official Images you find on DockerHub) or you build your own
Images by defining a Dockerfile.
- Dockerfiles contain instructions which are executed when an image is built ( docker build . ),
every instruction then creates a layer in the image. Layers are used to efficiently rebuild and
share images.
- The CMD instruction is special: It's not executed when the image is built but when a container
is created and started based on that image.

### Containers

- Containers are the other key building block Docker is all about.
- Containers are running instances of Images. When you create a container (via docker run ), a
thin read-write layer is added on top of the Image.
- Multiple Containers can therefore be started based on one and the same Image. All
- Containers run in isolation, i.e. they don't share any application state or written data.
- You need to create and start a Container to start the application which is inside of a Container. So
it's Containers which are in the end executed - both in development and production.

### Key Docker Commands

For a full list of all commands, add --help after a command - e.g. docker --help , docker run
--help etc.
Also view the official docs for a full, detailed documentation of ALL commands and features: https:
//docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/

  Important: This can be overwhelming! You'll only need a fraction of those features and
  commands in reality!

- `docker build .`: Build a Dockerfile and create your own Image based on the file
  - `-t NAME:TAG`: Assign a NAME and a TAG to an image
- `docker run IMAGE_NAME`: Create and start a new container based on image IMAGENAME (or
use the image id)
  - `--name NAME`: Assign a NAME to the container. The name can be used for stopping and
removing etc.
  - `-d`: Run the container in detached mode - i.e. output printed by the container is not
visible, the command prompt / terminal does NOT wait for the container to stop
  - `-it`: Run the container in "interactive" mode - the container / application is then
prepared to receive input via the command prompt / terminal. You can stop the
container with CTRL + C when using the -it flag
  - `--rm`: Automatically remove the container when it's stopped
- `docker ps`: List all running containers
  - `-a`: List all containers - including stopped ones
- `docker images`: List all locally stored images
- `docker rm CONTAINER`: Remove a container with name CONTAINER (you can also use the
container id)
- `docker rmi IMAGE`: Remove an image by name / id
- `docker container prune`: Remove all stopped containers
- `docker image prune`: Remove all dangling images (untagged images)
  - `-a`: Remove all locally stored images
- `docker push IMAGE`: Push an image to DockerHub (or another registry) - the image name/
tag must include the repository name/ url
- `docker pull IMAGE`: Pull (download) an image from DockerHub (or another registry) - this
is done automatically if you just docker run IMAGE and the image wasn't pulled before
